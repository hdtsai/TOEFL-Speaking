I think the most useful book for me is the bible. I am not a Christian, but it's still very helpful for me.
First, the Bible is like a historical book, in this book, you can see many stories happened again and again,
with the same results. History always repeats itself, By the Bible, I can learn how to avoid failures which the 
stories in the book had already happened.
Besides, many celebrities also recommend the Bible. Because our countries president is my role model, when he first 
recommend the Bible, I instantly order it on the website, and found its value.
So, I believe the Bible would be my life time partner.
