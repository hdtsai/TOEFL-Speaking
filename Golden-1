I think the most useful book for me is the bible. I am not a Christian, but it's still very helpful for me.
First, the Bible is like a historical book, in this book, you can see many stories happened again and again,
with the same results. History always repeats itself, By the Bible, I can learn how to avoid failures which the 
stories in the book had already happened.
Besides, many celebrities also recommend the Bible. Because our country's president is my role model, when he first time
recommended the Bible, I instantly ordered it on the website, and found its value.
So, I believe the Bible would be my life time partner.

For me, I would say that TV has more positive influence on society. In the modern world, people cannot live without new information
because everything changes so fast. You would lose your pace if you don't follow new informations.
So, TV is a good way to get various informations and it is quite accessible. It would be a perfect tools if you use it wisely. 
And I think overall it has a positive influence rather than the negative one.
